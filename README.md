# Welcome to ML.NET Workshop
ML.NET is a machine learning framework which is aimed at providing the Enterprise-to-Enterprise (E2E) workflow for adding ML into .NET apps across pre-processing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and operationalization.  There are so many powerful components in this framework. ML.NET comes with developer friendly set of APIs for model training and consumption. 

ML.NET is also extensible which means we can add additional popular third party frameworks like TensorFlow, ONNX and provide them under the same uniform set of API’s with ML.NET.
